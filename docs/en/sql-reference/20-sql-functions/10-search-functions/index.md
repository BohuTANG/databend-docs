import IndexOverviewList from '@site/src/components/IndexOverviewList';

Databend includes advanced full-text search functions, drawing on techniques similar to those in [Elasticsearch Full-Text Search Functions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/sql-functions-search.html).

These capabilities are especially valuable for executing searches that involve `MATCH` or `QUERY` predicates, ensuring efficient and effective data retrieval.
